# Brightness-Controller


1. Take the following required components from the kit.
● 1 x Breadboard
● 1 x LED
● 1 x 330-ohm resistor
● 1 x ESP32
● 1 x Potentiometer
● 1 x USB Programming Cable
● 11 x Male to Male Jumper wires

2. Connect all the components on the breadboard.

3. Connect the LED, resistor, potentiometer on the breadboard.
  
4. Connect the jumper wires from ESP32 pins to components. By doing this step, yourhardware is ready.
   
5. Click on the Project Template and download it.
   
6. Write your code in such a way that using the potentiometer, we can control the brightness of LED
